# Project Description

Our app bankify is a practice project that is supposed to simulate an online banking application which can handle banking transactions. The application can open and close accounts, transfer money from one account to another, upload checks, pay bills, and search for nearby bank ATMs. Accounts can be created and deleted with the cateogries checkings, savings, or credit. The amount of money in the credit account displays as negative. The application can run on computer and mobile devices.

# create-svelte

Everything you need to build a Svelte project, powered by [`create-svelte`](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/tree/master/packages/create-svelte).

## Creating a project

If you're seeing this, you've probably already done this step. Congrats!

```bash
# create a new project in the current directory
npm create svelte@latest

# create a new project in my-app
npm create svelte@latest my-app
```

## Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.

> To deploy your app, you may need to install an [adapter](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/adapters) for your target environment.
